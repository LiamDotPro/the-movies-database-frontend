Notes

1) I would of much rather started from something like create react app as project setup is very basic repeated code. Also you can eject further down the road if you get a specific scenario that requires advanced configuration.

2) I'll be using react router for scalability of declarative routing and simplisity, I don't want to recreate the wheel for routing when a small simple package is available and widely supported.
